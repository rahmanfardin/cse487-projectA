Certification process (Verification and Certificate Generation from CSR).
Transferring the certificate from AcmeCA to the server www.verysecureserver.com by SFTP/SCP/VM networking. 
Installation of the signed the SSL certificate in the server of www.verysecureserver.com
Making the system trust Acme-RootCA (the certificate of the SubCA should not be imported into the client PC). 
Implementation of a simple file uploading page in the server. 
Automatically redirect all http:// traffic to https:// 
Verifying the security of the connection by inspection (the padlock icon).
